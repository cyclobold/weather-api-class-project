# Weather Information Class Project

## This is a basic project for Python programming training that demonstrates the usage of: 
	- Application Programming Interfaces

## In this project, two APIs are used: 
	- The Open Weather Information API: Please get your API key here: 
	- Random User API: Please get your API key here: 


## OpenWeather API
Get information about weather condition based on your current location. In this project, I have removed my API key, but you should get yours and use in the appropriate place.

## Random User API
With this API, a random user can be generated for test purpose. 


## Note:
This project works with Python version 3.6. 3.7 does not work, this is because of the <mark>requests</mark> module, something I have been lazy to fix.
